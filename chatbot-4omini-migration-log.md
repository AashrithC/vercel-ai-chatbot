# Chatbot Migration to 4omini Log

## 2024-09-14: Initial Research and Planning

### What Was Done
- Researched integration of AI chat models with Next.js applications
- Explored streaming implementations for chat responses
- Investigated how to modify the existing OpenAI implementation to work with 4omini
- Created a detailed plan for the migration process

### Key Findings
1. **Current Implementation**:
   - The application currently uses OpenAI's API for the chatbot functionality
   - The implementation likely uses streaming responses for a more interactive experience
   - API calls are managed through a route handler in the Next.js app

2. **4omini Integration Considerations**:
   - 4omini likely has a similar API structure to OpenAI but with different endpoints and parameters
   - Need to verify if 4omini supports streaming responses
   - Authentication may be handled differently (API keys, tokens, etc.)
   - Response format may differ and require transformation

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Identify and modify the current chat API route handler to use 4omini
   - Update the response handling to match 4omini's format
   - Ensure streaming still works with the new provider
   - Add proper error handling for 4omini-specific issues

### Next Steps
1. Locate the current API route handlers for chat functionality
2. Find 4omini API documentation to understand its requirements
3. Create a test implementation to verify connectivity
4. Modify the existing chat implementation to use 4omini
5. Test the integration thoroughly to ensure it works as expected

## Challenges to Address
- Finding comprehensive documentation for 4omini API
- Ensuring streaming responses work consistently
- Handling potential differences in response formats
- Managing environment variables securely

## 2024-09-14: Analysis of Current OpenAI Implementation

### What Was Done
- Examined the OpenAI implementation in `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Analyzed how the streaming responses are implemented
- Reviewed the integration with Supabase for storing chat history

### Key Findings
1. **Current Chat API Implementation**:
   - Uses the Edge runtime for better performance with streaming
   - Leverages `openai-edge` and `ai` packages for integration
   - Implements streaming responses with `OpenAIStream` and `StreamingTextResponse`
   - Includes error handling for both streaming and general API errors
   - Saves chat history to Supabase in an `onCompletion` callback

2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - The chat API requires authentication
   - Uses the `auth` helper from `@/auth` to verify the user
   - Includes user ID in chat history records

3. **API Call Structure**:
   - Uses `openai.createChatCompletion` with the following parameters:
     - `model`: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
     - `messages`: Array of chat messages
     - `temperature`: 0.7
     - `stream`: true (for streaming responses)
   - Handles API keys and preview tokens

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements comprehensive try/catch blocks
   - Handles different types of errors (PostgrestError, general errors)
   - Logs errors to console
   - Returns appropriate HTTP error codes

### Migration Strategy for 4omini
1. **Identify API Differences**:
   - Determine the endpoint for 4omini API
   - Check if 4omini uses a similar chat completion API structure
   - Identify any parameter differences
   - Verify streaming support

2. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Replace `OpenAIApi` with 4omini client or direct fetch
   - Update API call parameters to match 4omini requirements
   - Modify the streaming response handling if needed
   - Maintain the same error handling structure
   - Keep the same integration with Supabase for chat history

3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Add 4omini API key to environment variables
   - Update configuration setup in the route handler

### Next Steps
1. Obtain 4omini API documentation and credentials
2. Create a test endpoint to verify connectivity
3. Implement the full migration
4. Test thoroughly with multiple chat scenarios
5. Monitor for any errors or performance issues
